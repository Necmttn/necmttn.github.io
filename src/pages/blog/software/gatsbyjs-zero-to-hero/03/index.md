When it's about styling in react community has bunch of alternatives.. and also I'm kind a relatively following this
topic pretty close and sofar. my favorite is [styled-components](https://github.com/styled-components/styled-components)
it's awesome project started by [Max Stoiber](https://github.com/mxstbr). He is also starter of [React-Boilerplate](https://github.com/react-boilerplate/react-boilerplate) one of the most famous react boilerplate project. which has over 15K star. 

He is one of the rockstar of the JS community.anyway that's enough of promoting Max , let's get start adding
`styled-components` like many other things gatsby also has a drop-in plugin for this. and you can install like this;

```
npm install --dev gatsby-plugin-styled-components
```
and add don't forget to add your `gatsby-config.js` following;
```
plugins: [
  `gatsby-plugin-styled-components`,
]

```
