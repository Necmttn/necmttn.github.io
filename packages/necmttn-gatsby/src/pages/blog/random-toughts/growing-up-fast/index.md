Sometimes life doesn't give to much option to decide when you wanna be grow as a man, You just have to. That's happen to
me when i decided to buy one way ticket to Shanghai. 

> I you're berave enough to say goodbye, life will awarded you with Hello's.

During the first year of the school in one of the boring classes i realize that. Somehow i need to go oveseas. I was
about 15-16 years old. I was trying to get Involve AFS (American TODO) but unluckly i never manage the go
